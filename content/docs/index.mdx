# Vector UI

**Vector UI** is a collection of reusable components you can seamlessly copy and paste into your web applications.

It focuses on components, blocks, and templates tailored for crafting compelling landing pages and user-facing marketing experiences.

## Philosophy

**I personally believe that good design contributes significant value to software. It's one of the main methods of establishing trust between you and an internet stranger**.  
Trust is critical for internet businesses—it’s the first thing a visitor evaluates before reaching for their wallet and becoming a customer.

Visitors often subconsciously ask themselves:

- "Is this company legit?"
- "Who else is using it?"
- "Can I trust them with my personal data?"

**Poor design reflects poorly on your team.**  
It feels lazy, unfinished, and unreliable. It sends the signal that the team doesn’t care deeply about the product or user experience.

**Good design signals that the team has their act together.**  
It creates a sense of confidence: "If they care this much about the tiny details, they must care about their customers too."

A perfect illustration of this is the [Linear](https://linear.app) landing page I saw in 2020.  
I didn’t even need to try the product—I *knew* it had to be good.
