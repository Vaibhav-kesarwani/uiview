# Installation

VectorUI will be soon available as an npm package, making it easy to install and integrate into your projects. Follow the steps below to get started *manually*.

<Steps>

### Install Tailwind CSS

Components are styled using Tailwind CSS. Follow the [official installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-vite) to add it to your project.

### Install Motion

Components are animated using [Motion](https://motion.dev/).

```bash
npm install motion
```

### Add the utility helper

Create a **`lib/utils.ts`** file to manage Tailwind CSS classes:

```ts
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from 'clsx';
import { twMerge } from 'tailwind-merge';

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

### Install icons

Add [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/) icons:

```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### That's it
You can now start adding components to your project. By using the manual installation and copy the code from the [components page](/docs/components/).
