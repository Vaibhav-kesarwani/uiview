## What is VectorUI?

VectorUI is a React UI library designed to help you build aesthetically pleasing and accessible user interfaces efficiently. It leverages
[Tailwind CSS](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/) and [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/index.html) to offer a seamless development experience.

VectorUI's core objective is to simplify the UI development process, providing a flexible and visually cohesive system for an enhanced user experience.

## FAQ

### Is VectorUI just a collection of pre-built components?

No, VectorUI is not just a collection of pre-built components. It offers fully functional, reusable components available via `npm` soon, allowing developers to install them individually or as a complete package.

### How does VectorUI differ from TailwindCSS?

- **TailwindCSS**:

  <div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
    Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides atomic classes for styling elements. However, developers need to manage accessibility, component logic, keyboard interactions, and style overrides manually.
  </div>

- **VectorUI**:
  <div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
    VectorUI extends TailwindCSS with pre-built components powered by React Aria, offering both styling and built-in accessibility. Since VectorUI is based on TailwindCSS, you can seamlessly apply Tailwind classes to its components while maintaining optimal CSS output.
  </div>

### How does VectorUI compare to other TailwindCSS component libraries?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  TailwindCSS component libraries like [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com/), [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/), and [Preline](https://preline.co/) provide curated class-based UI elements but lack built-in component logic, React-specific props, and accessibility enhancements.<br/>

  In contrast, VectorUI delivers a complete UI solution with fully functional React components, utilities, and accessibility features.
</div>

### How does VectorUI handle TailwindCSS class conflicts?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  We developed [tailwind-variants](https://www.tailwind-variants.org/), a utility library that intelligently resolves TailwindCSS class conflicts. This ensures that your custom styles always take precedence over default styles without redundancy.
</div>

### Does VectorUI require runtime CSS processing?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  No. Since VectorUI utilizes TailwindCSS as its styling engine, all styles are generated at build time. This eliminates the need for runtime CSS and ensures seamless compatibility with the latest versions of React and Next.js.
</div>

### Does VectorUI support TypeScript?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  Yes, VectorUI is fully written in TypeScript and provides comprehensive TypeScript support.
</div>

### Can I use VectorUI with frameworks like Vue or Angular?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  No, VectorUI is specifically built for React, leveraging React Aria. However, you can still apply its styling methodology to other frameworks.
</div>

### Why does VectorUI use Framer Motion for animations?

<div className="text-default-600 dark:text-default-500">
  We integrate [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion) to handle complex, physics-based animations efficiently. Framer Motion provides a robust, production-ready animation system that enhances user experience with smooth, high-performance transitions.
